					Menus are an integral part of a game as they are what allow a player to link any non-gameplay element to actual gameplay. 
					This update to the menu aims to take the simple landing page we had and turn it into a fully featured menu system.
The menu system now consists of the following features: 
A play button which leads to a choice of single or multiplayer game options, which then leads to previously existing menus, 
an options menu which leads to a sound menu which will be explained later on, a tutorial button which leads to a tutorial, 
an exit button which leads to a confirmation menu which allows players to quit the game organically and, 
back buttons on every menu which would finally allow players to go backtrack during menu traversal. 
Additionally, a pause menu which allows players to quit the game and win and loss screens have also been added.
The win and loss screens allow for the redirection of players after a game ends and allows them to restart another game. 
The pause menu can be toggled on or off during the game and has been implemented similarly to the player upgrade menu. 
It allows players to access the sound menu or the quit menu during a game. The pause menu does not however pause the game as it would be complicated to handle in an online environment.
Additionally, a sound menu has been implemented in order to let players have some acoustic control over  their experience. It features two sliders which are linked to the gameâ€™s two audio buses. The sliders allow for players to set the sound level of Music and sound effect from -80dB, which is silent to 0dB which is full volume. The sound menu was made as a separate scene which was then added to the different menus it appears in.
